Beta version v0.1
* Four new classes: Dragoon, Engineer, Hunter, and Infantry.
  * The Dragoon is a flexible support class. Its signature ability, Shield
    Protocol,  grants an allied unit an energy shield that absorbs a few points
	of damage. The Paladin subclass gains additional defensive and healing 
	abilities and can deal heavy damage with the LMG and heavy weapons. The 
	Ghost subclass focuses on stealth and speed, and can even take permanent
	control of enemy robotic units.
  * The Engineer is focused on grenades, both destructive and defensive. At
    Squaddie they gain the Smoke and Mirrors ability which lets them launch a
	smoke grenade without ending their turn. The Pioneer subclass further
	improves its smoke grenades while also gaining devastating shotgun attacks.
	The Sapper subclass instead focuses on destruction, and excels at removing
	enemies' cover and doing damage over large areas.
  * The Hunter's combination of sniper rifle and sword may seem unorthodox, but
    it is devastatingly effective. The combination of high mobility and long-
	range firepower gives them the flexibility to fight at any range. The
	Marksman subclass focuses on sniping from concealment and weakening
	enemies. The Tracker instead emphasizes mobility and massive sword attacks.
  * The Infantry class combines high damage with powerful control abilities.
    The Rifleman subclass focuses on the assault rifle,	with its Bullet Swarm
	ability providing unrivaled damage output. The Support subclass uses
	suppression and overwatch to pin down enemies and shoot them when they
	unwisely step out of cover.
* Several early-game items have been made available from the start of the game.
* Two new ammo types are available from the start of the game.
* Minor tweaks to some game rules and abilities:
  * A low hit chance will also lower crit chance.
  * Suppression prevents throwing or launching grenades, and suppression reaction shots have a +20 bonus.
  * The advanced grenade launcher has been nerfed to not provide additional grenade radius.
  * The AWC has been made retroactive.
