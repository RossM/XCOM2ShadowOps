Shadow Ops LW2 is a gameplay overhaul that replaces the Long War 2 classes with eight new classes. Requires Long War 2 to play.

[h1]Classes[/h1]
Each class in Shadow Ops LW has two main paths with distinctly defined battlefield roles and strong synergies between perks. That doesn't mean that you can only build soldiers along those paths, though - every ability is useful in the right situation.

[b]Combat Engineer[/b]
The Combat Engineer carries a shotgun and a grenade launcher for maximum destructive potential. Go down the Pioneer path to blow away cover with Breach and deal devastating criticals with Precision Shot and Aggression, or take the Sapper path and clear obstacles with Demo Grenades and protect allies with Dense Smoke.

[b]Dragoon[/b]
The primary defensive class, the Dragoon's signature GREMLIN ability Shield Protocol grants allies damage-absorbing energy shields. Build a Paladin to stand in the front lines absorbing damage with Tank and blowing away cover with a cannon Barrage, or create a Ghost to go undetected with Covert and cloak allies with Stealth Protocol.

[b]Hunter[/b]
The Hunter's unorthodox combination of sniper rifle and sword makes them deadly at any range. The Marksman path can execute devastating ambushes with First Strike and then vanish with Fade, while the Tracker can fight on the run with Snap Shot and Double Time while detecting enemies beyond line of sight with Tracking.

[b]Infantry[/b]
The Infantry's job is simple: shoot enemies. Bring a Rifleman to rain bullets with Light 'Em Up and take precision arc thrower shots with Stun Gunner and Electroshock, or take a Support to provide constant overwatch with Ready for Anything and extra healing with Field Medic.

[b]Juggernaut[/b]
The main problem with the Juggernaut is deciding how to kill the enemies: with a cannon plus the gauntlet's rocket launcher and flamethrower, there are a lot of options. Go Strike for close-range flamethrower and cannon destruction with Quickburn and Eat This!, or Siege to fire rockets and bullets at enemies beyond visual range with Fire In The Hole and Squadsight.

[b]Recon[/b]
A dedicated scout class, the Recon is well suited for either small-team stealth missions or supporting larger squads. The Vanguard excels in flanking with Hunter's Instincts and Shadowstep, while the Spotter stays hidden with Covert and paints enemies with the holotargeter with HiDef Holo.

[b]Scrapper[/b]
The Scrapper is a close-quarters combat specialist. Its signature ability, Bull Rush, can stun an enemy unit from anywhere in dash range. The Thug follows up with powerful shotgun attacks with Close and Personal and Hit and Run, while the Brawler prefers to finish foes off with the combat knife with Bare Knuckle.

[b]Survivalist[/b]
The Survivalist is a defensive sniper, able to neutralize multiple enemies each turn. Its backup sawed-off shotgun makes it quite capable at short-range combat, too. The Sentry can take overwatch shots even after firing or moving with Watchful Eye, while the Raider strikes panic into enemies' hearts with Fearsome.

[h1]FAQ[/h1]
[b]Q. Is Shadow Ops LW compatible with my existing mods?[/b]
A. Yes, Shadow Ops LW is compatible with almost all mods. It is not compatible with other Shadow Ops mods. There is a known incompatibility with the Reliable Smoke mod.

[b]Q. Can I use this without replacing the Long War 2 classes?[/b]
A. Yes. Remove all lines starting with "+LWClasses" from XComGameCore.ini in the mod's Config directory.

[b]Q. You did a balance update that changed perks. How do I fix my soldiers to have the right perks?[/b]
A. First, enable console commands if you haven't already. Open the soldier view for the soldier you want to change perks on in the armory, then open the console with "\" and enter "respec". This will reset all the soldier's perks and allow you to select new ones.

[b]Q. Can I make a remix of this, or reuse your code and art in my own mod?[/b]
A. Yes! I love seeing what other people can make from my stuff. All I ask is for appropriate credit.
